# my_clippings_to_markdown

v0.1.1

[Live on Github Pages here.](https://utkarshkunwar.github.io/my_clippings_to_markdown)

Converts Kindle's "My Clippings.txt" file to segregated Markdown files.

I built this because I wanted to seamlessly transfer my highlights from Kindle
to my personal Obsidian vault for personal note-taking.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Usage

1. Either copy/paste the contents of your `My Clippings.txt` file in the box or
   upload the file directly via the upload button.
1. You will be prompted for downloading a `highlights.zip` file which will
   contain several `.md` files (one file per book/document), containing the
   highlights.
